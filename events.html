                            <p>I was asked to present at the 2020 Graduate Induction with a colleague of mine, Luca Stamatescu. Together we spoke about some of the technological iniatives we had been working on in the Telstra Labs such as AI, ML, Drones and xReality. I also spoke about my graduate journey thus far and the most important things I had learnt.</p>

                            <p>Telstra Kids Fund is dedicated towards grassroots projects benefitting kids around Australia. Working with Telstra Kids I was able to secure a grant for Monash Toy Libraries, allowing them to reinvest into toys to promote digital literacy for kids. Monash Toy Libraries is a cause that is extremely close to me and it felt great to be able to give back.</p>
