                  <h3 class="h5 date-title">Learning Facilitator @ <a href="https://www.monashcollege.edu.au/" target="_blank">Monash College</a></h3>
                  <p>I worked part-time as a Learning Facilitator with Monash College. Within this role I was responsible for delivering Speak Up!. Speak Up! is a weekly class which was designed to help international students in assimilating to Australia and Australian culture. It had three work streams, which revolved around speech, confidence and Australian culture. Speak Up was an extremely successful program in which we constantly had classes of 20+ every semester. We constantly had students which were improving their understanding of Australian culture and confidence in verbal communication as they continued through the program.</p>

                    <p>As a head teacher for Code Camp, we run classes every holidays that enable primary school students to grasp the fundamentals of coding and programming through the creation of their own video game.</p>
                    <p>I was responsible for running and maintaining the progress and education of students attending our school holiday coding programs. I ensure that all of our students, regardless of age or experience end up with a greater understanding of how video games are made, basic programming functions such as 'If' and 'For' loops as well as enhance their creativity by allowing them to build and design their own video game.</p>
