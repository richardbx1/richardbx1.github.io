                        <h6>Rotation 3</h6>
                        <p>Currently working as a Data Scientist</p>
                        <h6>Rotation 2</h6>
                        <p>In my second rotation, I had two different roles as I worked across multiple projects.</p>
                        <p>The first project I was working with a Telstra Video Analytics product. As project manager, the project was to undertake a full product evaluation and get to the root of the problem. In completing this project, I was able to deliver a 40 page deep-dive technical report on the video analytics software and present to the Product Owners as to why it was not working. This gave the stakeholders an unbiased, in-depth understanding of every bit about the software side of their product, and they were better leveraged to sell their product in the market and also go back to their development team and correct the errors.</p>
                        <p>The other project was working with IoT Sensor product. This sensor collected information regarding office space optimisation and allowed the end-user to see when was busy, which rooms were busy in an office. Our task was to better utilise this data through Machine Learning. I was able to build a Predictive Algorithm that accurately predicted when desks would be utilised. By building this, we were able to influence office behaviour as if we told people this cluster of desks would be full on Wednesdays by 9:05, people began to come in slightly earlier so that they can sit as a team at our hot desk environments. I was also able to take this Proof of Concept into Production as we then hosted it on Azure and created an API service, allowing people to go to a URL and see the occupancy graph from anywhere.</p>
                        <h6>Rotation 1</h6>
                        <p>I worked within the IoT Connectivity team as we worked to launch a new SIM management platform. The platform would allow large enterprises to see all of their SIMs that they have connected with Telstra and manage them from a single pane of glass. The platform allowed people to manage connectivity and understand patterns in their usage.</p>
                        <p>Working with the Product Owner, my role was largely controlling Go-to-Market which meant that ensuring we were ready to launch on the deadline, ensuring the scope of the project was on track and that we met all business requirements. Also being part-Process Manager, I was responsible for a number of processes of the platform including Customer Onboarding and Support process. I was able to deliver delivery of the product to meet our T22 deadlines as well as ensure that all Process were in order by launch date.</p>

                        <p>I worked part-time as a Learning Facilitator with Monash College. Within this role I was responsible for delivering Speak Up!. Speak Up! is a weekly class which was designed to help international students in assimilating to Australia and Australian culture. It had three work streams, which revolved around speech, confidence and Australian culture. Speak Up was an extremely successful program in which we constantly had classes of 20+ every semester. We constantly had students which were improving their understanding of Australian culture and confidence in verbal communication as they continued through the program.</p>

                        <h3 class="h5 date-title">Head Teacher @ <a href="http://codecamp.com.au/" target="_blank">CodeCamp</a></h3>
                        <p>As a head teacher for Code Camp, we run classes every holidays that enable primary school students to grasp the fundamentals of coding and programming through the creation of their own video game.</p>
                        <p>I was responsible for running and maintaining the progress and education of students attending our school holiday coding programs. I ensure that all of our students, regardless of age or experience end up with a greater understanding of how video games are made, basic programming functions such as 'If' and 'For' loops as well as enhance their creativity by allowing them to build and design their own video game.</p>
