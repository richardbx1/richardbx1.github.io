              <p>Hi! My name is Richard. This page will highlight my vocational experience, the various projects I have been working on and as well as the events and philanthropic things I get up to. This page is designed to give you a deeper understanding that goes beyond my resume. </p>
              <p>A little bit about myself, I am a young parent to one (and hopefully two, soon!) beautiful daughter so most of my spare time is spent on her. We love doing all your typical family things such as going to the zoo, aquarium, farms and as well as just relaxing in the sun.  </p>
			  <p>I love all things to do with art and music such as photography, music, and fashion. I also love kids and one day hope to be a teacher later in life.</p>
