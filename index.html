                                  <p>Hi! My name is Richard. Welcome to my online portfolio!</p>
                                  <p>This page will highlight my vocational experience, the various projects I have been working on and as well as the events and philanthropic things I get up to. This page is designed to give you a deeper understanding that goes beyond my resume. </p>
                                  <p>A little bit about myself, I am a data scientist with an avid interest in all things revolving around technology. I am proficient in Python, R, software including Azure, Git, and Tableau. I think my strenths lie in analytical thinking, thought leadership and driving initiatives. </p>

                            <p>This was a personal project where I utilised and explored the OpenAI Model, GPT-2. GPT-2 is a model that is trained to predict the next word in a given sentence. I had finetuned the model using movie review data from Rotten Tomatoes and created an AI that was capable of writing short movie reviews.</p>

                          <p>The Smartspaces product is a Telstra IoT device that is designed to provide metrics around office space optimisation. I worked with the Product Owner and Software Developers to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that took historic data and then was capable of predicting how full an office space would be and which desks would be free at any given time.</p>

                          <p>Telstra Video Surveillance was a Telstra Product that I did a technical assessment on.

                            <p>I was asked to present at the 2020 Graduate Induction with a colleague of mine, Luca Stamatescu. Together we spoke about some of the technological iniatives we had been working on in the Telstra Labs such as AI, ML, Drones and xReality. I also spoke about my graduate journey thus far and the most important things I had learnt. </p>

                            <p>Telstra Kids Fund is dedicated towards grassroots projects benefitting kids around Australia. Working with Telstra Kids I was able to secure a grant for Monash Toy Libraries, allowing them to reinvest into toys to promote digital literacy for kids. Monash Toy Libraries is a cause that is extremely close to me and it felt great to be able to give back.</p>
