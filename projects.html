                                <p>When taking on personal side-projects, I try to ensure that they are enjoyable and will teach me a new skill that can be transferrable into my professional career, whether that skill be to do with software development, web development or data science.</p>
                                <p>My work projects are often centred around technological assessments or are data science-driven. The roles that I usually undertake are often leading as a project manager or taking lead as a Machine Learning Data Scientist.</p>

                        <p>The Smartspaces product is a Telstra IoT device that is designed to provide metrics around office space optimisation. I worked with the Product Owner and Software Developers to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that took historic data and then was capable of predicting how full an office space would be and which desks would be free at any given time.</p>

                        <p>Telstra Video Surveillance was a Telstra Product that I did a technical assessment on. I worked beetween the Product Owner and Software Developers to run a full dianogstic test on the software and provide reccomendations and improvements on what features were working, how they worked and how they could be further improved for the future.</p>

                        <p>This was a personal project where I utilised and explored the OpenAI Model, GPT-2. GPT-2 is a model that is trained to predict the next word in a given sentence. I had finetuned the model using movie review data from Rotten Tomatoes and created an AI that was capable of writing short movie reviews.</p>

                        <p>This website was a personal project that I took on because I wanted to understand more about front-end development. Designing and building this website has allowed me to understand and write HTML. This website is a constant work in progress and am hoping to be able to use it to showcase all of my skills and projects.</p>
