                            <h3>Introduction to OpenAI</h3>
                            <p>GPT-2 is a model trained by OpenAI on 40gb of internet text. Its job is basically to predict the next word in a given sequence of words. Because it is trained on such a large corpus of words, it has become excellent at writing text.</p>

                            <h3>What I Did</h3>
                            <p>I finetuned their existing model with movie review text from Rotten Tomatoes. What this fine-tuning does is that it learns the heuristics and characteristics of movie reviews such as, typical length, typical words and phrases that are included as well as picking up on actors and movie titles.</p>

                            <h3>What I Learnt</h3>
                            <p>Not only did this project give a glimpse at working with GPT-2, it taught me alot of other great things such as hosting API's via Docker and Google Cloud as well as HTML & Web Design. There were alot of components involved in this project end-to-end and I think it has given me alot of valuable skills for the future.</p>
